<p>
<a name="start_using"></a>
<h4 class="utilsubject">Start using the IECookiesView utility</h4>
This utility is a standalone executable, and it doesn't require any installation process or 
additional DLLs. In order to start using it, simply run the executable (iecv.exe)
from any folder you want. If you have a network, you can put the executable on the server, allowing all the 
workstations on the network to use this utility... And remember: No additional DLLs are required. As long as you have Internet Explorer (Version 4.0 and above) on your computer, it'll work !
<p>
If you want to create a shortcut to IECookiesView utility or to add a cookies button to Internet Explorer toolbar, you can easily do it by selecting the "Installation Options" option from the File menu.
<p>
If you have a previous version of IECookiesView, you can just overwrite the previous executable (iecv.exe), and start using the new one.
<p>
<h4 class="utilsubject">Uninstall IECookiesView</h4>
The IECookiesView utility doesn't provide an uninstall module, but in most cases, you can remove it from your computer simply by deleting the files of IECookiesView (iecv.exe and iecv.chm).
However, if you added a cookies icon into the toolbar of Internet Explorer (by using the "Installation Options" or /inst command-line option), you should remove it before you delete the IECookiesView utility.
<br>
There are 3 different ways to remove the cookies icon from the toolbar of Internet Explorer: (You have to use only one of them)
<ul>
<li>In the 'File' menu, select "Installation Options", verify that all 3 options are unchecked, and press the 'Ok' button.
<li>Run IECookiesView with /uninst command-line option (iecv.exe /uninst)
<li>In Internet Explorer application: Right-click on the main toolbar of Internet Explorer, and from the popup menu, select "Customize". In the "Customize Toolbar" window, remove the cookies icon from list of toolbar buttons.
</ul>  
<p>
The first and the second options also remove the shortcuts to IECookiesView in the desktop and in the start-menu.
<p>

<a name="main_window"></a>
<h4 class="utilsubject">The main window</h4>
The main window of IECookiesView contains two sub-windows: 
The top sub-window displays the list of all cookies files and their details. When you select (highlight) a cookies file in
the top sub-window, its cookies are shown in the bottom sub-window. Each cookies file has at least one cookie line in the bottom sub-window, unless it's deleted or corrupted.
You can increase and decrease the size of both windows by dragging the splitter to the right direction.


<a name="top_subwindow"></a>
<h4 class="utilsubject">The top sub-window</h4>
The top sub-window displays the details of each cookies file in 11 different columns. <br>
You can add, remove, or change the location of a column, by using the "Choose columns" option in the View menu.<br>
The following table provides basic information about each available column: <br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" bordercolor="#000000">
<tr class="utiltableheader"><th> <nobr>Column Name</nobr> <th>Description
<tr ><td>Web site <td> The Web site that use this cookies file.
<tr><td>Hits <td> Number of times that the cookies file was accessed by the Web site. This value is increased by one in each time that the Web site receives information from the cookies file.
<tr><td>Accessed Date <td>The last time that the cookies file was accessed by the Web site.
<tr><td>Modified Date <td>The last time that the cookies file was modified by the Web site.
<tr><td>Created Date <td>The time that the cookies file was originally created.
<tr><td>Size <td> The size of the cookies file (in bytes)
<tr><td>User <td> The logged-on user that accepted the cookie. For this column, there is a different between Windows 95/98/ME and Windows NT/2000/XP: <br>
				  <ul>
					<li><span class="special2">In Windows NT/2000/XP:</span>
					Each user has a separated cookies folder, so the value in this column is always identical for all cookies. 
					<li><span class="special2">In Windows 95/98/ME:</span> 
					Unless you explicitly create new user profiles, all users share the same cookies folder (in c:\windows\cookies), and thus you can watch the cookies of all users on the system.
				  </ul>

<tr><td>Filename <td> the filename of this cookie in the cookies folder.

<tr><td>Status <td>The status of the cookies file. It can be one of the following statuses:
			<ul>
				<li><span class="special2">Active: </span>The cookies file is active.  
				<li><span class="special2">Deleted: </span>The cookies file was deleted. Deleted cookies files will be shown only if "Deleted Cookies Files" in the View menu is checked.
				<li><span class="special2">Duplicate: </span>The record is a duplicate reference to the same cookies file. Duplicate references in the cookies index file are shown only if "Duplicate Records" in the View menu is checked.
			</ul> 


<tr><td>Ad <td>This column can help to identify unwanted advertising related cookies. <br>
		This column can contain one of the following values:
		<ul>
		<li><span class="special2">Yes: </span>The cookie file was created by a known advertising Web site. 
		IECookiesView uses the domains list in ads.txt for identifying the advertising related cookies.
		<li><span class="special2">Suspect: </span>The Web site that created this cookie file is possibly related to advertising. 
		IECookiesView identifies suspect Web sites by parsing the URL of the Web site. 
		<li><span class="special2">Unknown: </span>IECookiesView cannot determine whether the cookie file was created by an advertising Web site. 
		</ul> 
<tr><td>Domain <td>In many cases, one Web site might create cookies with different host names. 
		For example: yahoo.com might send you cookies with the following host names: groups.yahoo.com, local.yahoo.com, store.yahoo.com and more...<br>
		This column displays the domain name of the Web site, by extracting it from the Web site name. 
		If you sort the cookies list by this column, you can easily view all cookies of a specific Web site (e.g.: All cookies files of yahoo.com will be displayed in one chunk)
		<br>
		
		 
<tr><td>Record Number <td>
Displays the record number inside the cookies index file (index.dat)

</table>
<p>
When you click on a column header, the cookies files list is sorted by the clicked column. A second click sorts the column in descending order.
<p>
<a name="bottom_subwindow"></a>
<h4 class="utilsubject">The bottom sub-window</h4>
The bottom sub-window displays the details of the highlighted cookies file in 6 different columns: <br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" bordercolor="#000000">
<tr class="utiltableheader"><th> <nobr>Column Name</nobr> <th>Description
<tr><td>Key<td> The name of the cookie
<tr><td>Value<td> The value of the cookie
<tr><td>Domain<td> The domain name. It usually the same as the Web site in the top sub-window.
<tr><td>Secure<td> Specifies whether the cookie is secure.
<tr><td>Expiration Date<td>the expiration date of the cookie.
<tr><td>Modified Date<td>The last time that the cookie was modified by the Web site.
<tr><td>Created In<td>Specifies where the cookie was created:
<ul>
	<li><span class="special2">Server: </span>The cookie was sent to the client by the Web Server.
	<li><span class="special2">Client: </span>The cookie was created in the client (Internet Explorer) by using JavaScript or VBScript.
</ul>
</table>
<p>
When you click on a column header, the cookies list is sorted by the clicked column. A second click sorts the column in descending order.
<br>
Each line in the bottom sub-window contains an icon that indicates whether the cookie is expired or not. 
If a cookie is expired, a red icon will be displayed. otherwise, a green icon will be displayed. 
The expiration status is determined by comparing the expiration date of the cookie with the current local time of your computer.
When a cookie is expired (red icon), the Web site cannot use it anymore, unless it sends a new cookie, with a new expiration date.
