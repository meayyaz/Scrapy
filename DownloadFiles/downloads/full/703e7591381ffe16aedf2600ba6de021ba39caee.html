Creating a real console application in Visual Basic
</table>
<p>
Some development tools, like Visual C++ and Delphi, allows the developer to easily create console applications. These tools provides specific methods and functions for writing to the console screen and their compiler also provides special option for creating console executable.   
Unfortunately, Visual Basic doesn't support console applications. Even if you use the Win32 API for writing into the console screen, 
Your application won't work, because <span class="special6"> the Visual Basic compiler always creates GUI application and it doesn't provide any compiler options for changing it to console application</span>. 
<br>
But... with a small trick, it's possible to bypass the limitation of the Visual Basic compiler: <br>
I have developed a small utility that converts an Executable file (.exe) from GUI application mode to console application mode. 
So, you can develop a console application in Visual Basic, create an executable file, and then, use my utility to convert the executable into a console application. 
<br>
My utility was developed in Visual Basic, and the source code is provided within the sample package. You can use it by opening the appmodechange project from Visual Basic IDE.
<p>
In order to create a console application in Visual Basic, you have to use Win32 API calls.
<br>The following code snippet writes a few lines into the console screen, some of them are shown in different colors !

After you create an executable file from this code, you have to use the <a href="appmodechange.html">Application Mode Changer</a> for changing the executable mode from GUI application to console application.
<br>After you convert it to console mode, you'll get the following result: <br>
