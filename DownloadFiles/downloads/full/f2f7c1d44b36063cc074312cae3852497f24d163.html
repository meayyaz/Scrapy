<li><span class="special3">New .NK2 File</span> 
Start a newly empty NK2 file. You can add new records to the new file by using 'Add New Record' or 'Add Records From Address Book' options, 
or by Copy and Paste from another NK2 file.

<li><span class="special3">Backup Current NK2 File:</span>
Backup the NK2 that is currently opened. The backup file is saved with the same NK2 filename, but with
.NK2Edit.bak extension. For example, if the NK2 filename is Outlook1.NK2, the created backup filename will be 'Outlook1.NK2.NK2Edit.bak'. 


<li><span class="special3">Restore Last NK2 Backup:</span>
Restore from the last backup that was previously created with 'Backup Current NK2 File' option.

<li><span class="special3">Restore Backup From First Save:</span>
Restore from the backup that was created in the first time that you used NK2Edit with the current NK2 file.
Be aware that if you use NK2Edit for long time, this backup might be quite old.


<li><span class="special3">Save Current NK2 File:</span>
Save and overwrite the existing NK2 file.
You should use this option after you made all the changes you need and you want to save them into your NK2 file.

<li><span class="special3">Save As:</span>
Save into another NK2 file instead of the one that you originally opened.

<li><span class="special3">Export To Message Store:</span>
Outlook 2010 (and later versions) maintains 2 copies of the AutoComplete data. One copy in the local file system (Stream_Autocomplete_*.dat), and another copy
on the message store of your Outlook profile (PST file or Exchange server). This option allows you to copy the local AutoComplete .dat file into the message store of Outlook, to ensure that
Outlook will not overwrite your changes.
<br>
Be aware that if you have the x64 build of Outlook 2010 (and later versions), then you must use the x64 version of NK2Edit in order to use this options.
For Outlook 2010 32-bit, you have to use the 32-bit version of NK2Edit.


<li><span class="special3">Import From Message Store:</span>
Loads the AutoComplete data stored in the message store of your current Outlook profile (PST file or Exchange server).

<br>
Be aware that if you have the x64 build of Outlook 2010 (and later versions), then you must use the x64 version of NK2Edit in order to use this options.
For Outlook 2010 32-bit, you have to use the 32-bit version of NK2Edit.


<li><span class="special3">Open Default NK2 Folder:</span>
Simply open in Explorer the default folder that Outlook uses to save the .NK2 files.


<li><span class="special3">Export Selected Items:</span>

Be aware that the files created with this export option cannot be converted back into NK2 file.


<li><span class="special3">Export Records To Outlook Contacts:</span>
Allows you to export the selected NK2 records directly into the contacts of Microsoft Outlook.
See also: <a href="export_nk2_autocomplete_outlook_contacts.html">Export NK2 AutoComplete records into Outlook Contacts</a>


<li><span class="special3">New Email To Selected Contacts:</span>
Allows you to easily compose a new email message for the selected SMTP addresses.
The new message window is opened with your default email program.


<li><span class="special3">Open Selected Address In Outlook:</span>
Allows you to easily open the selected email address in Outlook.
If this email address has an enrty inside the address books of your Outlook profile, this
address book entry will be displayed. Otherwise, Outlook will open a simple dialog-box with the display name and email address.


</ul>


<li><span class="special2">Action</span> 
<ul>
<li><span class="special3">Edit Selected Record:</span>
Simply edit the selected record. When you choose this option, a new dialog-boxed with the selected record is opened,
and allows you to modify the values of this record.

<li><span class="special3">Add New Record:</span>
Add new record according to the display name and email/exchange string that you specify.
The search string and drop-down name are automatically filled for you.

<li><span class="special3">Add New Records From Address Book:</span>
Allows you to add multiple emails from the address book into your NK2 file.
This option works only if Outlook is installed properly on your computer.

<li><span class="special3">Add Records From Mailbox Recipients:</span>
This option allows you to scan your Outlook mailbox, collect the email addresses of all recipients that you sent/received messages in the last xx days, and then merge them into the NK2 file, according to the current merge mode.
The email addresses are sorted according to the sent/received time of the message, so the recipients that you sent them messages recently will be added in a better position.
<br>
By default, NK2Edit only scans and adds the email addresses from the messages that you sent.
You can also choose to grab email addresses from the received messages, but using this option may also add email addresses of spam/junk messages into your NK2 file.


<li><span class="special3">Add Records From Outlook Contacts csv File:</span>
This option allows you to add the emails/names stored inside Contacts csv file created
by the Outlook Export feature. You can also use contacts file created by other 
software or email service (like Gmail or Yahoo), as long as the file format is compatible with
the Contacts csv file of Microsoft Outlook.
<br>
Be aware that if the email address already exists in your NK2 file,
NK2Edit will merge it according to the current merge mode.

<li><span class="special3">Add Records From Simple csv File:</span>
This option allows you to import addresses from a simple comma-delimited (csv) text file.
For more information about the structure of the csv file that can be used with this feature,
read this page: <a href="import_nk2_addresses_csv_file.html">Import NK2 addresses from a simple comma-delimited (csv) text file</a>
<br>
Be aware that if the email address already exists in your NK2 file,
NK2Edit will merge it according to the current merge mode.
 

<li><span class="special3">Merge With Another NK2 File:</span>
This option allows you to easily merge all records from another NK2 file
into the currently opened NK2 file. 
 
 
<li><span class="special3">Delete Selected Records:</span>
Simply delete the selected NK2 records.

<li><span class="special3">Fix Drop-down Name And Search String:</span>
Set the Drop-down Name and Search String values for the selected records,
according to email and display name values.
This feature has the same effect of clicking the AutoFill button in the 
Edit Record window.

<li><span class="special3">Convert EX to SMTP:</span>
Converts the selected EX records to SMTP records.
This feature works only if the 'SMTP Address' value of the EX record contains the correct SMTP address.

<li><span class="special3">Remove Link To Outlook Profile:</span>
This option is useful only for SMTP records that are linked to specific Outlook profile (When 'Linked To Profile' column displays 'Yes')
<br>
Records that are linked to specific Outlook profile cannot be used in another Outlook Profile.
<br>
After removing the linkage to Outlook profile, you'll be able to safely copy the record into another AutoComplete file or move the entire AutoComplete file into another Outlook profile.


<li><span class="special3">Change Sending Format To:</span>
This option allows you to change the message format that Outlook will use when sending a message to the selected
SMTP recipients: Automatic (Let Outlook decide...), Outlook Rich Text, or Plain Text.
<br>
Be aware that if the 'Sending Format' is Outlook Rich Text, the recipient that receives the message will get
winmail.dat attachment if he doesn't have MS-Outlook or other email client that supports this message format. 


<li><span class="special3">Move Selected Records Up:</span>
<li><span class="special3">Move Selected Records Down:</span>
This option only works when the NK2 list is sorted by the index value (You have to click on the 'Index' column header).
It moves the selected records up/down to change their position inside the NK2 file.
You can use this option to set the order that the NK2 records are displayed in the Drop-Down of Outlook. 
However, when you send a message from Outlook, Outlook automatically move the sent email to a new position, so
the order you set with these options won't persist for long.

<p>
<b>Notice:</b> When you change the order of the NK2 records, it's recommended to 
set the weight values according to the new records order.
You can do it in 2 ways: by resetting all Weight values to 1 (see below) or by using
the 'Set All Weight Values By Records Index' option.

<li><span class="special3">Sort Index By Drop-Down Name:</span>
Sort the NK2 records so they'll appear in alphabetical order inside the drop-down of Outlook.
However, be aware that when the user send messages with Outlook, Outlook automatically put the 
destination email in the top of the NK2 records, and thus sorting the records with this option won't 
persist for long time.
<br>
Also, if you choose to use this option, it's also recommended to set
the weight values according to the new records order. (See the remark for Move Selected Records Up/Down)

<li><span class="special3">Sort Items By Weight Values:</span>
Sort the NK2 records according to their Weight values.
It's recommended to use this option after merging multiple NK2 files into one.

<li><span class="special3">Reset All Weight Values to 1:</span>
Simply set the weight value of all records to initial '1' value.

<li><span class="special3">Set All Weight Values By Records Index:</span>
Set the weight value of all records according to the current records index/order.
This option can be used after sorting the records with the other options (
'Move Selected Records Up', 'Move Selected Records Down', and 'Sort Index By Drop-Down Name'), 
so the weight values of all records will match the records order.
 

<li><span class="special3">Remove Quotes From All Display Names:</span>
Sometimes Outlook add unwanted single-quote characters into the display names of the NK2 file.
This option allows you to easily remove the unwanted single-quote characters from all records in the currently opened .NK2 file.
</ul>


<li><span class="special2">Edit</span> 
<ul>
<li><span class="special3">Find and Find Next:</span>
Simply find the desired record according to the text you type. Works on both edit modes.

<li><span class="special3">Replace</span>
Find and replace strings for selected records or for all records in the NK2 file.

<li><span class="special3">Remove Find/Replace Marks</span>
Remove the yellow marks of the last Find/Replace activity.

<li><span class="special3">Copy:</span>
Copy the selected NK2 records to the clipboard. You can use it with combination of 'Paste' menu item to copy NK2 records from one file to another.

<li><span class="special3">Copy As Tab Delimited:</span>
Copy the selected NK2 records to the clipboard in tab-delimited format. You can use this copy option to paste the 
NK2 records information into Excel, but you cannot use it to copy records from one .NK2 file to another.


<li><span class="special3">Copy As Emails List:</span>
Copy the selected NK2 emails to the clipboard as semicolon delimited list that can be used in the To/CC field of Outlook or 
other email software

<li><span class="special3">Copy Emails Only:</span>
Copy the selected NK2 emails to the clipboard , each email in a  separated line.

<li><span class="special3">Paste:</span>
Simply paste the records you previously copied.


</ul>


<li><span class="special2">Options</span> 
<ul>
<li><span class="special3">Raw Text Edit Mode:</span>
Special mode for advanced users that shows the content of the NK2 file in readable text format that looks
like the .ini file of Windows.

<li><span class="special3">Table Edit Mode:</span>
The default mode that shows all NK2 in a table.

<li><span class="special3">Merge Mode:</span>
<br>
Determines how Nk2Edit should behave when you try to add an
email that already exists in the NK2 records:

<ul>
<li>Always Add New Records: If this option is selected, new emails are always added, even if they already exist,
which means that duplicate records might be created.
<li>If Email Exists - Overwrite: If this option is selected, and you try to add a new record with email that already exists,
your new record will overwrite the existing record with the same email.
<li>If Email Exists - Don't Add: If this option is selected, and you try to add a new record with email that already exists,
your new record will be discarded.
</ul>

The Merge Mode affects the following actions: Copy/Paste, 'Add New Record',  and 'Add Records From Address Book', 'Add Records From Mailbox Recipients', 'Add Records From Outlook Contacts csv File'.

<li><span class="special3">Automatically Backup On First Save:</span>
If this option is selected, NK2Edit automatically creates a backup when you overwrite existing NK2 in the first time.

<li><span class="special3">Overwrite Question Before Every Save:</span>
If this option is selected, NK2Edit ask you whether you want to overwrite the existing file before any save.
If this question is annoying for you, you can turn it off.

<li><span class="special3">Ask Before Any Delete:</span>
If this option is selected, NK2Edit ask you whether you want to delete records.
If this question is annoying for you, you can turn it off.

<li><span class="special3">Ask Before Discard Changes:</span>
If this option is selected, and you try to exit or open another NK2 file after you made some changes in the current file,
NK2Edit will ask you whether you want to discard the changes.
If 'Save Question Instead of Discard Question' option is turned on, NK2Edit will ask
you whether you want to save your changes.

<li><span class="special3">Save Question Instead of Discard Question:</span>
If this option is turned on, and you try to exit or open another NK2 file after you made some changes in the current file,
NK2Edit will ask you whether you want to save the changes in the current nk2 file.
If this option is turned off, NK2Edit will ask you whether you want to discard the changes.


<li><span class="special3">Error Messages On File Open:</span>
If you turn off this option
(By default, it's turned on), NK2Edit won't display error messages when you open
corrupted .nk2 file with missing records or other errors.

<li><span class="special3">Automatically Export To Message Store:</span>
Relevant only to Outlook 2010 or later.
If this option is turned on, and you save the default AutoComplete file, NK2Edit will
automatically export the saved file to the message store of Outlook (PST file or Exchange)


<li><span class="special3">Use SMTP Address In AutoFill Feature:</span>
This feature affects the way that NK2Edit automatically fills the Drop-Down Name and the Search String of EX records.
If it's turned on, NK2Edit will use the SMTP address to fill the Drop-Down Name and the Search String.
If it's turned off, MK2Edit will use the Exchange account name.
<br>
For example: If this option is turned on, the Drop-Down Name will be 'Nir Sofer &lt;nirsofer@nirsoft.net&gt;'.
If this option is turned off,  the Drop-Down Name will be 'Nir Sofer &lt;NIRS&gt;'.


<li><span class="special3">EX Records AutoFill - Drop Trailing Numbers:</span>
This feature affects the way that NK2Edit automatically fills the Drop-Down Name and the Search String of EX records.
If this option is turned on, trailing numbers are dropped from the user name inside the Exchange string.
<br>
For example: 
if the Exchange email string is &quot;/o=First Organization/ou=Exchange Administrative Group/cn=Recipients/cn=John Doe234&quot;,
NK2Edit will set the 'Search String' field  to John Doe (instead of John Doe234) and the Drop-Down Name field to John Doe  &lt;John Doe&gt; (Instead of John Doe  &lt;John Doe234&gt;)




<li><span class="special3">Add Header Line To CSV/Tab-Delimited File:</span>
If this option is selected, header line containing the column names is added when you export to csv or tab-delimited file.
This option also affects the Control Center window.


<li><span class="special3">Mark Duplicate Records:</span>
If this option is selected, duplicate records with the same display name or email address are marked
with the same color.

<li><span class="special3">Associate .nk2 Extension With NK2Edit:</span>
If this option is selected, the .nk2 extension inside Windows Explorer is associated with NK2Edit,
which means that NK2 files with be displayed with the icon of NK2Edit and when you double-click on NK2 file,
it'll be opened with NK2Edit.
<br>
Be aware that this option is irrelevant for Outlook 2010, because Outlook 2010 saves the AutoComplete files with .dat
extension instead of nk2 extension.
Also, be aware that the file association is made only for the current user (HKEY_CURRENT_USER Registry key)
